# Rigor DG1022Z Generator

## Overview
A multi-channel waveform generator designed for precision signal simulation in electronic testing and development. Here we use for arbitrary waveform output.

## Key Features
MAX. OUTPUT FREQUENCY: 25MHz
SAMPLE RATE: 200Msa/s
VERTICAL RESOLUTION: 14bit
CHANNELS: 2CH
ARBITRARY WAVE LENGTH: 2M(16M opt.)


## Interface：
           USB 
​
## Demand： Python Code
Example：Generate a user-defined arbitrary ramp wave with 10μs period, 4V high level and -4V low level.
 
The vertical resolution of user-defined arbitrary wave is 14 bits, 0 and 16383 separately correspond to the minmum and maximum amplitudes, that is: -4 V corresponds to 0 and 4 V corresponds to 16383. So, edit the points in following table to generate the specified ramp wave.
 
0 *IDN? /*Query ID to check the operating state */ 
1 FUNC USER /*Select user-defined arbitrary wave*/ 
2 FREQ 100000 /* Set the frequency as 100kHz (period: 10μs)*/ 
3 VOLT:UNIT VPP /* Set the unit of voltage*/ 
4 VOLT:HIGH 4 /* Set the high level*/ 
5 VOLTage:LOW -4 /*Set the low level*/ 
6 DATA:DAC VOLATILE,8192,16383,8192,0 /*Load the 4 decimal numbers to volatile memory */ 
7 FUNC:USER VOLATILE /*Output the waves in volatile memory */ 
8 OUTP ON /* Enable the [Output] connector of CH1 at the front panel */
*What we need, is to read a txt / CSV file to get the arbitrary waveform data，change the data in command 6 and change the FREQ in command 2, then, send string  command 0-8 to device for output.
