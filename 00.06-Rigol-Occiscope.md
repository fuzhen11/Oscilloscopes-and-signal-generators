Need install Ultra Sigma first. Then determine the serial port number of the device and connect it, and send the SCPI command to the device through a string. What we need by MSO5354 is that，real-time acquisition of digital and analog signals of different channels, real-time drawing and save as a txt file in accordance with the format. If the file has two columns, the first column is the time and the second column is the analog. Each channel can be recorded individually.
